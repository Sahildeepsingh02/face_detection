# Face Detection
## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a Face Detection Model using VGG16 for feature extraction, Albumentations for data augmentation, and TensorFlow/Keras for training the model. OpenCV is used to capture images from the webcam and create a custom face dataset. The model is capable of detecting faces in real-time through live webcam feed.
## Technologies Used
  - Tensorflow
  - OpenCv (to create data)
  - Albumentations (for data augmentation)
  - VGG16
  - Matplotlib
